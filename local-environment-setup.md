Went to github.com and create an account called iniles and verified my email address.
Accepted invite to 698 organization. 
Through Git downloaded notes repository as a zip, which I don’t know how to open md files.
Installed Git Client, and ran bash terminal automatically.
Attempted to install docker, requires docker toolbox to run. 
Have to enable virtualization in bios to run docker terminal
I have been doing this all on the class laptop… time to go into the bios
